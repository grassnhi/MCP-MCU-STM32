# Microprocessors – Microcontrollers Course Repository

Welcome to the Microprocessors – Microcontrollers Course Repository! This repository serves as a centralized resource hub for all course-related materials, including labs, lessons, exercises, and assignments.

## Contents

1. **Labs:** 

- Folder Lab0: STM32 tutorial exercises for labs.
- Each branch contains a exercise of a specific lab.


2. **Lessons:** 

This section contains my personal exercises and notes from the theoretical classroom sessions. These resources aim to supplement my understanding of microprocessors and microcontrollers, bridging the gap between theory and practice.


3. **Assignments:** 

In this project, the STM32F103RB is used to simulate the 2-way traffic light system, having some main features:
- Automatic mode: 
The system operates as normal. The  light colors are red, yellow, and green.
- Manual mode: 
A button is used to switch the light colors in this mode.
- Tuning mode: 
This mode is used to modify the light timing length.
- Pedestrian scramble: 
When the button for pedestrian is pressed, its light is turned on and operates reversely to the light of vehicles.
